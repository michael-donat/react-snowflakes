# react-snowflakes

Let it snow on your React website!

```jsx
import Snowflakes from 'react-snowflakes';

// Insert anywhere in your code and that's it!
<Snowflakes numberOfSnowflakes={50}
            snowflakeColor="rgba(0,0,0,.2)"
            snowflakeChar="*"/>
```

Snow is falling thanks to [this guy](https://www.kirupa.com/html5/the_falling_snow_effect.htm).
